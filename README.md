What makes a good controller design?

It is hard to define a “good design” for a controller, as some controllers can be more suitable for different games, such as driving games where a steering wheel controller is used. For the most part a single is controller is made for a selected console to be used for every game released on that console, so designing the best controller for it is an important part of the process. 

Below is a set of design components that should be followed when designing a controller.

Games facilitate?

Will there be any game mechanics that the current controller does not have.

Controller

What particular input device would apply to those mechanics.

Interface

How will the controller work?



Uniqueness

When a new controller appears on the market they are always different to their predecessors, meaning that they should not already exist out there. This allows the controller to seem new and exciting but still retain its primary build.

Interaction

A controller must be good for the type of game it is used for, allowing fluent commands straight into the game.

Reality

A controller should be able to be constructed from off the shelf parts and other controllers rather than creation of new materials.

Durability

A controller should be able to last an all day usage test.
